  <div class="destinations"><b>Arusha – Tarangire </b></div>

  <br>
 
 
    <div class="itinerary"><b>Tour Briefing</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Unless your arrival time yesterday allowed time for your safari briefing, then this will take place after breakfast. We will provide you with all the essential information, before we set off to our first safari destination, the diverse Tarangire National Park, where we will enjoy lunch, take an afternoon game drive and spend the night.</div><br>

<div class="itinerary"><b>Journey: Arusha to Tarangire National Park</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Our two-hour morning journey first takes us westwards from Arusha. Along the route, your eyes will be opened to all the colours and character of Tanzania: perhaps some Maasai herdsmen driving their flocks of goats to new pastures. You’ll get to know your driver-guide, amazed at his depth of knowledge as he effortlessly answers all your questions. </div><br>


<div class="itinerary"><b>Day’s Highlight</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Your game drive in Tarangire, with its incredible diversity, massive baobab trees and herds of elephants.</div><br>


<div class="itinerary"><b>Safari (Game Drive) in Tarangire National Park</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Tarangire is huge. As you stand at the park gate and look south, it stretches as far as the eye can see. Known as the ‘Elephant Playground,’ this phenomenal park contains huge herds of these mighty mammals. But Tarangire is also home to buffalo, lion, wildebeest, zebra and gazelle and the park can rival Serengeti for sheer animal densities. What might you see today? Perhaps a solitary male lion stretched out beneath a tree, perhaps a trio of male cheetah enjoying some lazy bonding-time in the sun. Maybe some graceful Grant’s gazelle or zebra bounding away from the road or a couple of giraffe munching happily from the choicest acacia branches. For Tarangire specialities, look out for kudu and oryx.<br>
Here as in other parks, it pays not to ignore the small animals. It’s so easy to be mesmerized by the power and majesty of an elephant or the elegance of the giraffe. Ask your guide to find you an agama lizard, especially a male one who changes colour in front of you according to the temperature! Or a hyrax, known as pimpi, an insignificant-looking creature of around 30cm in length…who astonishingly is related to the elephant!<br>
Not many trees will pass you by without something of avian interest catching your eye. A memorable flash of colour might be a lilac-breasted roller or blue-eared starling. Ostrich are plentiful and it’s hard not to chuckle at the sighting of the well-named, studious-looking secretary bird as it awkwardly pads across the grasslands. <br>
The park is also famous for its splendid baobab trees, rolling savannah and acacia woodland. It can be dusty – wear a scarf over your mouth - but this is a minor inconvenience for sighting wildlife in such abundance.

<div class="itinerary">Our accommodation tonight will be at the <b>Tarangire Tortilis Camp</b>. Off the beaten track, and far from the park’s other camps and lodges, this is a great wilderness experience. The nearby Gursi swamplands ensure that warthog, zebra and other mammals are attracted to this area as they come to drink. After a long day, you can kick back, take a drink yourself and watch an unforgettable sunset.<br>
Tarangire Tortilis is located around four magnificent specimen of the iconic baobab tree, which is characteristic of Tarangire National Park. Away from the noise of the busy park gates, this safari camp combines comfort with tranqullity, a sense of freedom and being at one with nature.
You can be assured that you will be warmly welcomed by an enthusiastic team, keen to turn your stay here into something rather special. You’ll enjoy dinner tonight at the camp.

<div class="itinerary">Your close encounters with nature and wildlife on your morning walking safari.</div><br>


<div class="itinerary"><b>Walking Safari in Tarangire</b></div>

<div class="itinerary">Up close and personal: that could be the motto for a walking safari, and Tarangire is a fantastic location to again leave the comfort of your safari vehicle and enjoy the landscape on foot. With a Park Ranger for safety and accompanied by your expert driver-guide, you will be amazed at how much more you can learn from a couple of hours walking in the bush. The great unknown, of course, is what you will see…and who you might meet! Your senses are challenged and heightened, with unfamiliar sounds and smells meeting you throughout your journey. You’ll find out about animal tracks and dung, learn what to do if you get too close to a grazing elephant and discover who lives in those emblematic, strange-shaped termite mounds (and it’s not just termites, far from it!) Being this close to nature may be a whole new experience for you, but the memories will stay with you forever – of that we are sure.<br>
After our walking safari, we will take a break for lunch, before we take our afternoon game drive.

</div><br>


<div class="itinerary"><b>Afternoon Safari (Game Drive) in Tarangire National Park</b></div>

<div class="itinerary">You may have thought that you have seen all that Tarangire has to offer, but you will certainly enjoy some new experiences as we explore the park further in our afternoon game-drive.<br>
The varied terrain in itself could be considered a wonder, with riverine woodlands and grasslands, acacia and baobab. Tarangire is a true dry season refuge for the region’s wildlife. Amazingly, some 550 bird species have been recorded here, and it won’t be long before an air-bound blaze of colour alerts you to something interesting. You might recognise an ostrich or a stork, but if you can’t identify the smaller species, there’s no need to worry – that is what your expert driver-guide is here for!<br>
The birds are exotic and so are the names: what about the ‘white-bellied go-away bird’ or the ‘Madagascar bee-eater’ for example? But of course, we will also see plenty more large mammals this afternoon.

 <br>
 
  
 <div class="itinerary">Today we leave Tarangire, but not before taking a final look with a game-drive through the park on our way to Ngorongoro. We lunch on arrival at Ngorongoro, before descending into the crater in the afternoon.</div> <br>


<div class="itinerary"><b>Journey: Tarangire-Ngorongoro</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Our journey from Tarangire to Ngorongoro takes us to the northwest, a journey of around 4 ½ hours.
</div><br>



<div class="itinerary"><b>Day’s Highlight </b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Like nothing else on Earth, the stunning crater of Ngorongoro is a unique home for many, many species of Tanzania’s wildlife. With some luck, you may even see a black rhino here. 
</div><br>

<div class="itinerary"><b>Safari in Ngorongoro Crater     </b></div>
<div class="itinerary">From the rim, we admire the incredible view then  descend into the vast crater itself.  At one side there’s the Lerai Forest, classic mountain forest landscape with almost tropical characteristics. This is good elephant country, so keep your eyes peeled. By the side of the nearby swampland is what is sometimes called the ‘elephant graveyard’ as the mighty male tuskers at the end of their lives come to chew on the soft, swampland grasses once their teeth have failed them. <br>
The crater has a population of around 120 lions, with well-defined territories; 15,000 wildebeest, 9,000 zebra, 400 hyenas, and around 50 black rhino. Many wildebeest and other herd animals are resident, benefiting from the many sources of year-round waters and are boosted by some migrators in season. Buffalo, Thomson’s gazelle and eland are also present in numbers. Hippos can be found in pools and swampland and highland birdlife is colourful and plentiful around the waters. Flamingos can often be seen in Lake Magadi, which occupies part of the crater floor.

<div class="itinerary">Our <b>Ngorongoro Tortilis Camp</b> is only a 20km drive from the crater itself (around 40 minutes), set beneath an atmospheric acacia ‘umbrella,’ located in dense, sloping woodland and adjacent to a traditional Maasai community.  Some will call the set-up here ‘glamping’, and it certainly offers a great level of comfort, considering the wilderness location. The nearby Ol Mote and Makarot mountains give it an added dimension, but it is the warm welcome of the staff which is the highlight for many of the visitors here. You’ll enjoy the team’s singing and dancing, perhaps you will even be tempted to join in. You can relax, have a drink, sit in front of the camp fire, and listen to the sounds of the noisy tree hyrax who live nearby. Then, enjoy dinner - and fall asleep, dreaming of the day’s highlights.

Then, feast yourselves on a truly superb dinner and your driver-guide will discuss the plans for the next day’s itinerary in the Serengeti. Afterwards, review the photos that have captured the day’s highlights, before falling asleep to get ready for another day of adventure.

 <br>

<div class="itinerary"><b>Day’s Highlight</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Today, we set off from our accommodation in the Central Serengeti. Wildlife is abundant: sometimes you may think it has come to find you, rather than the other way around. Today’s highlight is unknown, as the animals don’t publish their schedule (!) What we see also depends on the season, but this area is where bushland meets grassland, a favorite spot for big cats looking for prey. Cheetah, leopard and lions are all possibilities today.</div><br>


<div class="itinerary"><b>Safari in Serengeti National Park  </b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Today is a full day of discovery, a chance to enjoy the varied landscapes of the Central Serengeti. The Seronera River weaves its way through this area, providing waters for all species of wildlife. You will also see the distinctive rocky outcrops, the famous kopjes which characterize the Serengeti landscape. Lunch will be an unforgettable experience, enjoyed in the middle of the bush. Everything here varies with the seasons, but in May, November and December migrating herds join the already rich population of resident animals which live here year-round. (In the rainy season, the landscape turns black with hundreds of thousands of wildebeest – a simply incredible sight.)

<div class="destinations"><b>Serengeti National Park – Lake Eyasi </b></div>
  

 <br>


   
<div class="itinerary"><b>Journey: Serengeti National Park – Lake Eyasi</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">After a morning game drive and lunch, this afternoon we will head south to Lake Eyasi, a journey of around 4 ½ hours.</div><br>

<div class="itinerary"><b>Day’s Highlight</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Although we will have another chance this morning to marvel at the Serengeti, perhaps today’s highlight will be our meeting with some of our country’s fascinating tribespeople. Today, we will meet the Datoga in their traditional village houses.</div><br>


<div class="itinerary"><b>Safari in Serengeti National Park <b></b></b></div><b><b>
<div class="itinerary">With its informative visitor centre, the Seronera area of Central Serengeti is the national park’s most popular area. And it is very popular with the wildlife, too. The Seronera river enjoys year-round waterflow, so there is always something of interest to observe. Several game drives can be undertaken here and might reveal lions in sizeable prides, hippo or herds of elephants - whose populations in the park have risen in recent times. Depending on other attractions, we may choose to call in at the Serengeti Visitor Centre, where there is an excellent explanation of the park’s eco-system and a chance to understand the history of conservation in this area. In particular, you will find out about the work of Bernhard Grzimek and the Frankfurt Zoological Society who had the foresighted vision of preserving the Serengeti’s eco-system. Even at the center, you may well find wildlife: populations of hyrax and mongoose, as well as many small bird species.  
</div><br> 


<div class="itinerary"><b>Datoga tribe, Lake Eyasi <b></b></b></div><b><b>
<div class="itinerary">After lunch, we head south to Lake Eyasi. Here, we have an opportunity to remind ourselves that Tanzania is rich in human culture, as well as rich in fantastic wildlife. The Datoga tribe are our hosts this afternoon, as we are introduced to their village, customs and traditions. A colorful experience, not to be forgotten!

 <br>


<div class="itinerary"><b>Journey: Lake Eyasi – Lake Manyara</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">After breakfast and our morning visits to see the Hadzabe hunter-gatherers and the local blacksmith, we d journey to Lake Manyara, a 2-hour journey, where we have our lunch and embark on our afternoon game drive.</div><br>

<div class="itinerary"><b>Day’s Highlight</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Everyone will have their own, favorite cultural experience today. But perhaps your lasting memory will be of the Hadzabe hunter-gatherers. Their lifestyle will make you ponder how uncomplicated – though not easy - life can be. </div><br>


<div class="itinerary"><b>Lake Eyasi and its Tribespeople  <b></b></b></div><b><b>
<div class="itinerary">Lake Eyasi is located in the Great Rift Valley, southwest of the Ngorongoro Crater. Its salt-water levels experience dramatic changes with the seasons: in years with little rainfall, the lake can almost disappear. Near to the shimmering lake, we will first experience a hunting trip with the Hadzabe, the last hunter-gatherers in Tanzania, before visiting a local blacksmith as he practises his craft, fashioning pots and weapons from scrap metal. <br> 
We then continue to Lake Manyara, where we have our lunch and take our afternoon game drive.
  
</div><br>

<div class="itinerary"><b>Safari (Game Drive) in Lake Manyara National Park<b></b></b></div><b><b>
<div class="itinerary">After our lunch, we jump in our vehicle to cover the highlights of this park. Set against the rugged Rift Valley escarpment, and characterised by its shimmering lake, Manyara is rich in vegetation and the wildlife that thrives here. Enjoy the tranquillity as majestic pink flamingos wade elegantly, picking out a meal of algae from the shallow, alkaline waters. On land, Manyara’s terrain is compact, yet boasts differing environments such as diverse forests fed by waters seeping from the nearby escarpment. Monkeys are abundant, but look out too for the lions, giraffe, warthog and grumpy Cape buffalo who all call this park ‘home’. Hold your nose when we reach the hippo pool, because these big lumps smell!

Unlike many accommodations in this area, this unique camp is located actually inside the National Park, and it’s also perfectly placed for spectacular sunrises. Small and intimate, it is staffed by a team of warm and welcoming personnel, eager to ensure you enjoy your stay here. Wildlife roam freely amongst the tents, there’s an atmospheric ‘fireplace’ for you to take a drink, and the tents themselves will surprise you with their levels of comfort.

<div class="itinerary"><b>Lake Manyara Walking Safari</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Our morning walking safari gets you very quickly into the safari mood. Accompanied by a park ranger, you will be so close to Mother Nature, discovering wonders too small to see from a 4x 4 vehicle. Perhaps your guide and ranger will explain the importance of the rhino-horned dung beetle, or exchange bird calls with the sulphur-breasted bull shrike. Maybe you’ll taste a desert date, a popular snack for monkeys! And all the time, you’ll feel the tension that only a walking safari can bring: the desire to find large mammals conflicting with the need to stay safe!<br>
In silence, in single file, you’ll make your way through the bush, perhaps stumbling across a giraffe chomping on high branches or a herd of elephants grazing gently. Don’t worry, your ranger is an expert: your safety is his chief concern.

<div class="itinerary">
Tipping is of course discretionary, but is an expected part of the way in which business is done in Tanzania. It counts as an expression of gratitude to those who – hopefully – have made your experience an unforgettable one and enables you to directly reward those people.
Our passengers come from all around the world, with different cultural attitudes to tipping, but a tip is of great significance here in Tanzania and will be hugely appreciated by the recipient. We know that the act of giving of a tip can be a bit awkward and we would suggest that the best way to remove this ‘awkwardness’ is for each couple to put their tip anonymously into an envelope and for the envelopes to be presented by the couple to the staff member. As a guideline, you should consider tipping at the following levels:
<br><br>
<div style="padding-bottom: 10px"> Driver guide: $25 US per day, per couple. </div>

For hotels/lodges/tented camps, please do not tip individual staff members, but instead use the ‘Tip Box’, which you should find at the reception of your accommodation. For guidance, you should consider tipping between $5-7 US per day, per guest, at each accommodation.

<div class="destinations" style="padding-top: 20px"><b>Trip Duration</b></div>

<div class="itinerary">
  Please note that all our itineraries begin at Kilimanjaro International Airport, with an overnight hotel stay in Arusha included in the price. This means that where an itinerary is entitled, for example, ‘9 Days Experience Tanzania Culture and Safari: Tarangire, Ngorongoro, Serengeti, Lake Eyasi, Manyara,’ then the arrival day and Arusha overnight stay will count as Day 1. This is simply because our visitors come from all over the world and the flights can arrive at any time of day. If you are already in Arusha prior to the start of the safari and do not need the Arusha overnight stay that we provide, please inform your Easy Travel tour consultant and we will remove the cost of the Arusha hotel from the tour price. <br><br></div>



<br><br>

<div class="destinations"><b>Options To ‘Fly In/Fly Out’</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">
This itinerary is based on transportation by vehicle. Our reliable, comfortable 4 x 4 vehicles will pick you up at the airport at the start of your safari and take you back to the airport at the end. Our Tanzanian roads are very rough in places and distances between the national parks are not insignificant. On this safari, there may be the option to reduce the time spent in your vehicle, by flying to your first safari destination at the start of your safari, or by flying back at the end of your safari, or both. These options of taking an internal flight or flights do attract an extra cost. If this is of interest to you, please ask your Easy Travel tour consultant at the time of booking your safari and they will be happy to advise you </div> <br>

<div class="destinations"><b>Back Pain</b></div>
<div class="itinerary"> All visitors will spend some significant time in our comfortable vehicles on the rather rough roads of Tanzania. Anyone who is liable to back pain may experience severe discomfort and should satisfy themselves as to the suitability of a safari (and take medical advice if appropriate) before booking.</div><br>



<div class="destinations"><b>Visitors With Limited Mobility</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">Please note that our itineraries are not suitable for those with limited mobility or who are physically disabled. Our vehicles are not capable of being adapted to accommodate those people, unfortunately.</div>
<br>

<div class="destinations"><b>Wildlife Spotting</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">
Please note that we cannot guarantee the sighting of any particular animal or bird during our safaris. In our itinerary descriptions, we make reference to many of the animals you may see, but these references are for illustrative purposes only. For example, your driver-guide will do all he can to find you a black rhino if you are visiting Ngorongoro, but such animals are rare. While no sightings of any particular animal can be guaranteed, a quick read of our visitor reviews on Tripadvisor will show you what incredible wildlife experiences our visitors enjoy. And remember: the more days you book, the more wildlife encounters you will have.</div> <br>

<div class="destinations"> <b>Types of Safari:  Migration Safaris</b> </div>
<div class="itinerary">
All of our Migration Safari itineraries are designed to give visitors the best possible opportunities of seeing The Great Migration, and our driver-guides are passionate and experienced in finding you the best wildlife experiences. Visitors should be aware, however, that the wildlife act according to the availability of water, not to the schedule of any safari operator. When booking a Migration Safari, you may have an expectation of witnessing a ‘river crossing’ but there can be no guarantee that this will take place on any particular day. If the wildebeest don’t want to cross, then no crossing will take place. Many of our Migration Safaris will visit two different locations – for example the Western Serengeti and the Northern Serengeti. But should you see a crossing in Western Serengeti, do not also expect to see one in the Northern Serengeti on the same safari. Nature and the rains will always dictate the whereabouts of the animals, and the migrating herds cannot be in two separate places at the same time!</div>

<div class="destinations"> <b>Serengeti National Park: Programme Changes</b> </div> 
<div class="itinerary">
Our aim is always to keep you safe and to give you the best experiences. We will only make changes to your chosen itinerary for one of those two reasons. Bear in mind that as accommodation is pre-booked, your itinerary will not change substantially. However, where visitors are spending multiple days in Serengeti National Park, the driver-guide may change the itinerary from day-to-day, according to conditions, travelling time and what is happening in the park. So, where – for example - the itinerary description indicates that you will go to the Visitor Centre on Day 4, your driver-guide may decide to visit it on Day 5 instead. If he does make a programme change, he will have a good reason for it and he will inform you.

<div class="destinations"><b>A word about our lunches</b></div>
<div class="itinerary">
We know that a day’s safari can make you hungry and we ensure that we always provide you with a balanced and nutritious lunch that will leave you satisfied. Generally, we provide you with either a picnic lunchbox or a hamper lunch. You can read more about these here. On any particular day, we wish to remain flexible: after all, there may be times when the last thing you want to do is interrupt your wildlife-watching simply to watch your driver-guide set up a picnic table. On such occasions, it may be preferable to eat a lunchbox at the designated picnic sites, to ensure that you don’t miss any excitement! We will try to offer you something different each day, working with the hotels, camps and lodges to ensure that your midday meals are a pleasurable experience. 
Bon appetit!
